                <h1>Love Notes for My Gwapa Prinsesa</h1>
                <p>I've always loved your handwritten notes baby, it's something that we share in common po. There's just something
                    about knowing that you took some time out of your day and wrote of the contents of your own heart with fingers 
                    beautiful and lovely. There's just nothing else like it except when the day comes when I can look into those 
                    beautiful brown eyes of yours baby. I'll see everything you're feeling inside and the rising waves and sunsets 
                    of your heart when looking into those gorgeous eyes of yours my gwapa prinsesa. But even still, a love note is 
                    something that can be carried in the wallet and kissed when we're away from each other. Can be pulled from your 
                    purse when you're missing me after a long day, a physical reminder of each other when days are hard and difficult, 
                    and when life becomes burdensome, your notes have given me strength when nothing else worked and when my heart had no 
                    peace. It is your loving notes to me and the sound of your voice that gives me a strength to keep going in life po. It's 
                    my hope and sincere desire, that these little notes written by my own hand, may bring you peace on your hardest days. And 
                    fill you with warmth on the coldest nights my gwapa prinsesa. I love you more than words could ever say and life is 
                    meaningful and beautiful all because of you my lovely Wifey!
                </p>

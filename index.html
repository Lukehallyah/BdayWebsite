                <p>I hope your day is filled with lovely things and all the things that make you smile my pretty pretty 
                baby. Life is beautiful and it's all because of you and I feel incredibly lucky to be by your 
                side every day, to celebrate with you means the world to me and today is all about 
                celebrating the amazing lovely woman you are my beautiful sunshine!
                </p>
                <p>Today we celebrate 21 years of life of the most amazing person I've ever met, Baby you are strong
                and beautiful, kind and compassionate, lovely in every way from the top of your head to the bottom of 
                your feet but you are so much more than that po, you are an amazing and wonderful person to be around 
                and life would be meaningless without you baby. Every day you wake is a beautiful day to me and although 
                I know that life isn't easy and obstacles always come in life, it's easier because we have each other 
                baby. You inspire me every day to be the absolute best version of myself I can be, I see the things you 
                overcome every day and I say to myself "If she can do it, then so can I!". 
                </p>
                <p>When I think of happiness, of good things and of beautiful things, of things real and alive and honest,
                when I think of the sunshine in the morning or the sunset in the evening, I see your smile baby, in my mind
                I see you my gwapa prinsesa. You are everything lovely and worth living for and you and the Lord Jesus mean
                everything to me. Life wouldn't be life without you and it couldn't be life without you by my side po, you 
                make every day feel real and alive to me baby, like I was living in a foggy wasteland before I met you and 
                then all of a sudden a light shone: thru the fog and I saw your eyes there and that beautiful smile of yours 
                that just causes me to melt inside. I'm a big strong man who can take on the world! Until I see those bright 
                gorgeous brown eyes of yours and I just melt my pretty pretty baby.
                </p>
                <p>Happy Birthday my beautiful sunshine, you make life worth living, and every smile and every memory we 
                create together is more than precious in my eyes. I'm excited baby, more than excited po! Excited to celebrate
                your birthday with you baby, to see your smile and know that I am by your side baby: my Gwapa Prinsesa incredibly special and 
                precious to me in every way! I hope today is filled with many pink and blue bows, with plenty of Whity cuddles and 
                hanging out with the animals. With many beautiful sunflowers gleaming in the afternoon sun, and with fields of roses 
                and many many bright pink tulips for you to see and enjoy. My love I hope that there's plenty of stickers for you today 
                and lots of beautiful drawings and that you know that you are loved by me, and also by Nanay, your friends, and 
                your family too, that today is celebrated as it should be: to celebrate the extraodinary and lovely person you are in 
                every way my love of my life!
                </p>
                <p>Happy Birthday my gorgeous sunshine, happy birthday my Jenjen, my lovely Jo, my beautiful Wifey, 
                my world and my universe, I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you 
                so much my pretty pretty baby, I hope today is filled with all the lovely things you love and enjoy and 
                you deserve the world my Gwapa Prinsesa! HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE i LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY LOVE

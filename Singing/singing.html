                <h1>Songs of Our Love</h1>
                <p>Singing is alot like dancing baby, it takes the entire heart and soul and places it into song, the movements 
                    of dance like the singing of the heart working together to bring out the soul of the singer, the heart of 
                    the dancer. There are many days when I'm in wastewater alone, when I will raise my heart and soul in song to
                    you where only the Lord can hear and my heart sings of you my love, of our hopes and our song, or our journey and 
                    our dreams together love.

            <h2>You Are My Sunshine</h2>
            <p>The first song I ever sang to you my love, and the song that it was said my grandpa sang to 
                my grandma all the time po chu. A very special song that is very near and dear to my heart and 
                perfectly describes my love for you my gwapa prinsesa. You are and always have been the sunshine of my life 
                and you make every day lively and bright to me my love. Without you life couldn't be life to me baby, there 
                wouldn't be anything in this world that could ever make me smile if something ever happened to you. Finding 
                you and being by your side is the most beautiful feeling in all the world and I will always be by your side 
                loving you more and more every single day, feeling like the most blessed man in all the world and it's all 
                because of you my beautiful sunshine.
            </p>

            <h2>I Found You</h2>
            <p>This is our song baby, the song that defines us my love and although life can bring so much against us, 
                I know that no matter what happens we will always find our way to each other. I've never in my life felt 
                that I belonged and I was always looking for my forever home. I searched for years and years and years and 
                then I found my home: it was you my gwapa prinsesa. My chu my baby and my entire world, I know we've been thru 
                so many things together and I know that we have alot of hurdles and challenges we will face in life together but 
                I know that we can do anything we put our minds to because we have each other. You mean everything to me my love 
                and I love you more than you could ever know! You're the reason I keep on breathing, the reason I keep believing, 
                the reason I can keep going in a world that can often be painful. In such a world as this, I'm glad I found my better 
                half and my soulmate, my joy and my happiness, my life and my breath in you, in you my pretty pretty baby, I love you 
                so much my gwapa prinsesa, I love you more than you could ever imagine!

                <h1>Songs of Our Love</h1>
                <p>Singing is alot like dancing baby, it takes the entire heart and soul and places it into song, the movements 
                    of dance like the singing of the heart working together to bring out the soul of the singer, the heart of 
                    the dancer. There are many days when I'm in wastewater alone, when I will raise my heart and soul in song to
                    you where only the Lord can hear and my heart sings of you my love, of our hopes and our song, or our journey and 
                    our dreams together love.
                </p>

            <h2>You Are My Sunshine</h2>
            <p>The first song I ever sang to you my love, and the song that it was said my grandpa sang to 
                my grandma all the time po chu. A very special song that is very near and dear to my heart and 
                perfectly describes my love for you my gwapa prinsesa. You are and always have been the sunshine of my life 
                and you make every day lively and bright to me my love. Without you life couldn't be life to me baby, there 
                wouldn't be anything in this world that could ever make me smile if something ever happened to you. Finding 
                you and being by your side is the most beautiful feeling in all the world and I will always be by your side 
                loving you more and more every single day, feeling like the most blessed man in all the world and it's all 
                because of you my beautiful sunshine.
            </p>

            <h2>I Found You</h2>
            <p>This is our song baby, the song that defines us my love and although life can bring so much against us, 
                I know that no matter what happens we will always find our way to each other. I've never in my life felt 
                that I belonged and I was always looking for my forever home. I searched for years and years and years and 
                then I found my home: it was you my gwapa prinsesa. My chu my baby and my entire world, I know we've been thru 
                so many things together and I know that we have alot of hurdles and challenges we will face in life together but 
                I know that we can do anything we put our minds to because we have each other. You mean everything to me my love 
                and I love you more than you could ever know! You're the reason I keep on breathing, the reason I keep believing, 
                the reason I can keep going in a world that can often be painful. In such a world as this, I'm glad I found my better 
                half and my soulmate, my joy and my happiness, my life and my breath in you, in you my pretty pretty baby, I love you 
                so much my gwapa prinsesa, I love you more than you could ever imagine!

            <h2>Blue by Yung Kai</h2>
            <p>When I heard this song for the first time, I imagined holding you close and singing gently in your ears. 
                In my mind we were laying down on a towel on the beach watching the sunset, hearing the sounds of the waves 
                crash against the shore while watching the sun sink behind the waves. In my mind I could feel your warmth and 
                you were so soft, your skin soft and supple and your muscles relaxing into my arms and the soft tones of my 
                voice singing in your ears as your eyelids soften and you drifted off to sleep. So many times during my day at 
                work I sing this song to you, practicing with my voice the desperate longing of my heart to hold you close in my 
                strong embrace. Every day is a beautiful day with you my love and you'll never know how much I love you my pretty 
                pretty baby. There's no words strong enough, no song deep enough, only the meeting of our souls will ever be able 
                to truly express my boundless and intense desire of you my gwapa prinsesa. I love you so much baby, and every day 
                feels like a blessing because of you my chu, my lovely Jo, my gorgeous Wifey!

            <h2>I Think They Call This Love</h2>
            <p>When you asked me to sing this for you a while back chu, I had never heard this song but it came to me as naturally 
                as breathing! I think you know me so well and my voice that you knew the perfect way I'd be able to express myself 
                in singing to you, to pull out my innermost feelings in the form of music which comes so much more naturally to me 
                than words and phrases. How could this all encompassing love that I feel for you inside, ever be completely expressed 
                thru words or song or poems? A love for you that I feel inside that is natural to me as breathing, is as much a part of 
                me as my own soul and my own heart, you are me, and I am you baby and we are one together my lovely Jo. A beautiful song 
                for an amazingly lovely person, baby you are beautiful and gorgeous in every way and may every day that we live, my actions 
                show how much I love you and how much you mean to me. Because without you I have nothing and I am nothing chu, you are 
                and always have been the better part of me po. 
            </p>

            <h2>Can't Help Falling In Love With You</h2>
            <p>Chuuu we both love those old fashioned types of love, the love where feelings are shown and are raw and powerful. 
                This song is a representation of the love that we have together po chu. Originally this was a song that Elvis sang 
                and sometimes I sing it with his cadence and voice. Every time I sing this song, I think of coming in and sweeping 
                you off your feet, I think of picking you up in my arms and cradling you as we walk down the street chuuu and who cares 
                who is looking ahahaha, I want the world to know that you are mine! There's this part of me that maybe I hardly ever show 
                that is more spontaneous and although I can seem stoic and things there's this boyish charm I feel inside every time I'm around 
                you baby. A happiness that could never be placed into words, because there are no words to describe the endless love I feel for 
                you. How could infinity and the whole of the universe ever be described? I know of only one way, it must be my future in 
                those lovely gorgeous brown eyes of yours my love.

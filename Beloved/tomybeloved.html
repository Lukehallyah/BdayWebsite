                <p>Chuuu I just wanted to take some time to say what an amazing person you truly are. Your smile
                    lights up every room you're in and your laugh is intoxicating. I could listen to the sound of your
                    voice every moment of every day and I'd never become tired, and baby I can't get you out of my mind: no 
                    matter what I'm facing during my day or when I wake in the middle of the night, you're always on 
                    my mind and you are my heart baby.

                <p>Baby you are incredibly beautiful, and the Lord never made anything in this world like you po. 
                    No scenes of nature whether it be ocean or mountain, luscious valley or dry and mysterious 
                    desert, nothing could ever compare to you because you are these and so much more my gwapa prinsesa.
                    Your eyes chu, I've never seen anything like your eyes before baby, playful and alluring in every way 
                    inviting me to come hold you close to me, at other times I can see when you're not feeling your best 
                    and something bothering you chu, and at other times I see the tiger within you strong and fierce and 
                    determined in a way I've never seen before! Every day I dream of pulling you onto my lap, your legs 
                    around me, my arms wrapped around your lower back and resting our heads together, looking into those 
                    beautiful gorgeous brown eyes of yours. When I look into your eyes I see the universe inside of you, so 
                    many things that words alone could never describe the many wonderful things I see in you my pretty pretty 
                    baby.
                </p>

                <p>The way you smile baby, there's nothing more beautiful in all of God's creation. I look at the dandelions 
                    outside and the sunflowers, the wings of the bluebirds and the sight of the mountains, and nothing baby, 
                    nothing could ever come close to your smile, your gorgeous lips I dream of kissing every day. Your skin 
                    is soft and lovely and trying not to embarrass or make you uncomfortable, but baby you are my every desire 
                    and every inch of you from head to toe is perfect to me. You're my crush and my love of my life, perfect in 
                    every way even if sometimes it's hard for you to see po chu, I only wish you could see yourself thru my eyes 
                    one day baby, I think you'd blush my lovely Jo.

                <p>And more than how beautiful you are on the outside, is how lovely you are on the inside, I'm a lucky and 
                    a blessed man above all the men who have ever walked on Earth before me or ever will after me. Because you 
                    are an extraordinary person baby, you work really hard with a determination and a tenacity that I've never seen 
                    before, taking care of your family and friends even when things aren't easy, and you take care of me too baby: 
                    every good morning, and every good night, every moment that you and I share together is more than precious to me 
                    my love. You are strong in every way, capable of amazing things and capable of changing the world baby, you are 
                    amazing and nothing is too strong for you and you fight for what you believe in and that's the most beautiful thing 
                    ever baby: you never give in and you always try your best my gwapa prinsesa.

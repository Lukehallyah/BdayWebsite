                        only a small fraction of the beautiful journey we are walking together, a journey 
                        of love and commitment, of love and kindness and support for one another. And with every 
                        day that passes, I fall deeper and deeper in love with you my gwapa prinsesa.

<!--So the idea is this:

Firstly I'm creating a simple but meaningful title that opens the web page for my baby, chuuu if you're reading this
it means just the title and a subtitle. Maybe a paragraph or so underneath.


Then I'll create a grid system. Don't know how I'm going to do it yet but it has to be responsive to 
mobile and probably only two pictures in each column meaning only two columns and who knows how many rows.
Ill let this scroll down forever and ever and ever. There's going to be so many pictures baby ahahahah

I was going to make a hover feature for when your mouse hovers over a picture but knowing you baby, you're 
probably going to be using your phone so optimizing it for mobile makes the most sense. I wish I had thought 
about that from the beginning when I was designing the original html. But I learned alot along the way.

SOUND: I want to implement some type of sound, whether it's me singing or maybe Blue by Yung Kai or something
 you really like chu. I want to make this really enjoyable and personal to us baby. 

 Other than that, I might try and throw in a video every now and then just to test my chops. After making 
 that Grid pattern on the "beloved" page, this should be a cinch.

 I'm so excited tho baby, I have to remind myself to eat and to rest my eyes every now and then. I would do 
 anything to see that beautiful smile of yours my gwapa prinsesa!

 Note to self: how do you plug emojis into code? Now that would be something to find out ahhahahah

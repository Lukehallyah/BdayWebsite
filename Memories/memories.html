                    <p class="p-two">My love, these are a collection of some of my favorite pictures and memories 
                        of us together. Every memory with you is more than precious to me, and this is 
                        only a small fraction of the beautiful journey we are walking together, a journey 
                        of love and commitment, of love and kindness and support for one another. And with every 
                        day that passes, I fall deeper and deeper in love with you my gwapa prinsesa.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p-one">The Journey of Our Love</p>
                    <p class="p-two">My love, these are a collection of some of my favorite pictures and memories 
                        of us together. Every memory with you is more than precious to me, and this is 
                        only a small fraction of the beautiful journey we are walking together, a journey 
                        of love and commitment, of love and kindness and support for one another. And with every 
                        day that passes, I fall deeper and deeper in love with you my gwapa prinsesa.

                    <h2>My Phone Background</h2>
                    <p>Baby I can remember the morning you sent me this picture chu, I was at work and dreading
                        being there because who wants to be at work right aahahahahh. But then you sent me this
                        picture and other ones and Lord have mercy you look so cute! TO THIS DAY one of the 
                        cutest pictures you've sent me baby! The way your move your lips and those gorgeous brown eyes 
                        of yours, but what makes me smile inside, is the joy I see in your eyes. I would do anything to see 
                        you smile my pretty pretty baby, I'd move heaven and earth itself to look into those beautiful eyes 
                        of yours my gwapa prinsesa!

                 <div>
                    <h2>My Baby, My Entire World</h2>
                    <p>Oh my goodness chu! I remember the day you sent me this one baby and the pictures and videos that 
                        you sent me chuuu and whoa you look gorgeous! This one was one of my phone backgrounds for awhile 
                        and I'd open my phone and kiss every day (kinda like how I do now with the picture above). I could 
                        rest my eyes on you every moment of every day and find something new I love about you every day my 
                        love, you're beautiful inside and out and I don't know where I'd be without you chu, you show me how 
                        beautiful life can be every day by your side my love.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Filipiniana, Traditional Dress</h2>
                    <p>When you told me that you'd have to find a way to get a Filipiniana at first I had no idea 
                        what you were talking about chuuu but I was very interested baby. I don't know what it is but I like 
                        seeing you try on all kinds of clothes and a chance to learn about your culture at the same time? Count 
                        me in! But nothing could have prepared me for how beautiful you are baby. When you sent me this picture 
                        baby I could feel my heart stop for a moment, your eyes and how beautiful you are took my breath away my 
                        gwapa prinsesa.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Gwapa Prinsesa</h2>
                    <p>When you told me that you were looking into dresses to wear back then I imagined all sorts
                        of dresses you could wear chu. You showed me a few and you looked absolutely beautiful but nothing 
                        could prepare me for when you showed me this dress baby. It was perfect for you, like it was tailor 
                        made just for you and it looked gorgeous on you! And the pictures you showed me of you wearing, like 
                        this one above, baby you took my breath away. Just when I thought to myself that you couldn't look more 
                        beautiful than you are, you go and take my breath away my beautiful sunshine! One day, when we are together 
                        here or there and shopping chu, it's my biggest dream to see you try on all kinds of clothes. Everything looks 
                        amazing on you and there's just something about you that causes whatever you try on to shine. You are beautiful 
                        in every way baby and breathtaking to me. When I see your smile chu, you take my breath away and for the space of 
                        a few moments I forget how to breath, forget who I am, because the only thing I can think about is how gorgeous you 
                        are my gwapa prinsesa. My prinsesa, my gwapa gwapa prinsesa, baby I love you more than words could ever say!

                <h2>Gorgeous Brown Eyes</h2>
                <p>While the first picture may be my home screen, this one is my lock screen because I love this picture 
                    so much baby. When you made this one for me, to you it may seem like another picture chuuuu but to me this 
                    is one of my favorites you've ever sent me po. There's just something about your eyes baby that makes me want to 
                    wrap my arms around you and pull you close to me, looking deep within my gwapa prinsesa! Sometimes when I'm having 
                    a really rough day, I'll click the button on the side of my phone and I'll look into your eyes, and there's so many 
                    things I see inside of you baby. There is playfulness and a loveliness about you that makes me want to chase you and 
                    chase you and chase youuuuu. There's also strength po, a strength I've never seen before in anyone but you, the strength 
                    that no matter what happens I know that you can do anything baby. I can see sleepiness too sometimes and it's the cutest 
                    thing ever and makes me want to cuddle with you and rest and rest and rest. There's a universe of goodness and strength, 
                    bravery and willpower, sultriness and alluringness, Love and compassion, care and attention, I can see all of these things 
                    and so much more in those gorgeous brown eyes of yours my love. And the more I see every moment and every day, the deeper 
                    I fall in love with you my pretty pretty baby!

                <h2>Lovely Inside and Out</h2>
                <p>They say that the most beautiful moments in life take us by surprise. And it's these moments that we 
                    share together that show me how amazing you are chu, and how lucky I truly am po. When you send me 
                    this one the other day that you had made, you melted my heart baby. The first thing I noticed were 
                    the cutesy stickers and I smiled chu, even as hard of a week as it had been you instantly can make me smile 
                    baby. And then I noticed the bible verses, and my heart was comforted by you baby, the words of the Lord 
                    always manage to help me feel even better baby and taking in the whole journal before me I realized your heart 
                    being laid plain for me baby, and then I realized how hard it is for you to show someone and I felt unbelievably 
                    special chu. To be able to share this moment with you, knowing how hard it must have been to be vulnerable showed 
                    me in this moment how much you trust me baby. And I felt more than anything, more than grateful and proud that you 
                    shared with me your heart my love. The tulips at the bottom were the cherry on top chuuu because I know how much you 
                    like tulips and I smile every time I see this picture baby. I look through our pictures all the time, thanking the Lord 
                    and happy that I can share every moment with you my love. You'll never know how special you are to me, more than precious 
                    in my eyes baby, I love you I love you I love you so much more than you could ever know my pretty pretty baby!

                <h2>Our Journey Together</h2>
                <p>You and me baby, always and forever my gwapa prinsesa! When you send me this one, baby I had no idea 
                    how you had made this but it's still one of my favorites to this day that you have sent me and it seems 
                    like the perfect last picture for this section of the website chuuuu. You captured perfectly how much I miss 
                    you and really want to be there by your side to hold you and wrap my arms around you holding you close. And I 
                    know that long distance isn't always easy, but we have each other and our love grows more and more by the day, 
                    every day that you and I have together is more than precious in my eyes and I never thought that I would ever be 
                    this happy in life baby. I've not only found my better half in you, but I've also found my soulmate, my partner in 
                    crime, my favorite person, and the love of my life. I know that we've both been thru alot of things lately and with 
                    school and work life can sometimes be a handful chu, but always know that no matter what happens you'll always have 
                    someone you can confide in me. I'll be here to hold you tight, to be a shoulder for you to cry on and to be your comforter 
                    when life becomes hard and unbearable. When everything seems so heavy, and the weight of the world is on your shoulders, 
                    always know that I'm here by your side and you're never alone baby. I see inside of you great strength, a potential to 
                    change the world and a loveliness that is hard to put into words, you take my breath away and you are beautiful inside 
                    and out. Every moment, of every day, I fall deeper in love with you and this journey we walk together is special to me, 
                    more than precious in my eyes is every moment that you and I share together baby, and you'll never know how much you truly 
                    mean to me. Words alone could never describe my love for you, only time and presence can begin to show, and always know 
                    that you have your biggest supporter in me. I will always always always be by your side to support you no matter what happens 
                    and I love you more than life itself! I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you so much my gwapa 
                    prinsesa and I'm looking forward to every moment and step that we have together my love: growing together and loving each 
                    other more and more every day my gwapa prinsesa!

<!--So the idea is this:

Firstly I'm creating a simple but meaningful title that opens the web page for my baby, chuuu if you're reading this
it means just the title and a subtitle. Maybe a paragraph or so underneath.


Then I'll create a grid system. Don't know how I'm going to do it yet but it has to be responsive to 
mobile and probably only two pictures in each column meaning only two columns and who knows how many rows.
Ill let this scroll down forever and ever and ever. There's going to be so many pictures baby ahahahah

I was going to make a hover feature for when your mouse hovers over a picture but knowing you baby, you're 
probably going to be using your phone so optimizing it for mobile makes the most sense. I wish I had thought 
about that from the beginning when I was designing the original html. But I learned alot along the way.

SOUND: I want to implement some type of sound, whether it's me singing or maybe Blue by Yung Kai or something
 you really like chu. I want to make this really enjoyable and personal to us baby. 

 Other than that, I might try and throw in a video every now and then just to test my chops. After making 
 that Grid pattern on the "beloved" page, this should be a cinch.

 I'm so excited tho baby, I have to remind myself to eat and to rest my eyes every now and then. I would do 
 anything to see that beautiful smile of yours my gwapa prinsesa!

 Note to self: how do you plug emojis into code? Now that would be something to find out ahhahahah

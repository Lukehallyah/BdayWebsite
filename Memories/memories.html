                    <p class="p-one">The Journey of Our Love</p>
                    <p class="p-two">My love, these are a collection of some of my favorite pictures and memories 
                        of us together. Every memory with you is more than precious to me, and this is 
                        only a small fraction of the beautiful journey we are walking together, a journey 
                        of love and commitment, of love and kindness and support for one another. And with every 
                        day that passes, I fall deeper and deeper in love with you my gwapa prinsesa.

                    <h2>My Phone Background</h2>
                    <p>Baby I can remember the morning you sent me this picture chu, I was at work and dreading
                        being there because who wants to be at work right aahahahahh. But then you sent me this
                        picture and other ones and Lord have mercy you look so cute! TO THIS DAY one of the 
                        cutest pictures you've sent me baby! The way your move your lips and those gorgeous brown eyes 
                        of yours, but what makes me smile inside, is the joy I see in your eyes. I would do anything to see 
                        you smile my pretty pretty baby, I'd move heaven and earth itself to look into those beautiful eyes 
                        of yours my gwapa prinsesa!

                    <h2>My Baby, My Entire World</h2>
                    <p>Oh my goodness chu! I remember the day you sent me this one baby and the pictures and videos that 
                        you sent me chuuu and whoa you look gorgeous! This one was one of my phone backgrounds for awhile 
                        and I'd open my phone and kiss every day (kinda like how I do now with the picture above). I could 
                        rest my eyes on you every moment of every day and find something new I love about you every day my 
                        love, you're beautiful inside and out and I don't know where I'd be without you chu, you show me how 
                        beautiful life can be every day by your side my love.

<!--So the idea is this:

Firstly I'm creating a simple but meaningful title that opens the web page for my baby, chuuu if you're reading this
it means just the title and a subtitle. Maybe a paragraph or so underneath.


Then I'll create a grid system. Don't know how I'm going to do it yet but it has to be responsive to 
mobile and probably only two pictures in each column meaning only two columns and who knows how many rows.
Ill let this scroll down forever and ever and ever. There's going to be so many pictures baby ahahahah

I was going to make a hover feature for when your mouse hovers over a picture but knowing you baby, you're 
probably going to be using your phone so optimizing it for mobile makes the most sense. I wish I had thought 
about that from the beginning when I was designing the original html. But I learned alot along the way.

SOUND: I want to implement some type of sound, whether it's me singing or maybe Blue by Yung Kai or something
 you really like chu. I want to make this really enjoyable and personal to us baby. 

 Other than that, I might try and throw in a video every now and then just to test my chops. After making 
 that Grid pattern on the "beloved" page, this should be a cinch.

 I'm so excited tho baby, I have to remind myself to eat and to rest my eyes every now and then. I would do 
 anything to see that beautiful smile of yours my gwapa prinsesa!

 Note to self: how do you plug emojis into code? Now that would be something to find out ahhahahah

Hey baby, this is the first website I'll ever make you and 
kind of serves as like a sort of old school "memory card"

I know with AI and everything that making websites may 
eventually become a thing of the past baby, but as long
as I can be creative and make something special for you 
baby I will, if only to see your smile baby.

I live for your smile baby and the look of your beautiful
brown eyes, baby you make me blush inside chu. Yea it feels
weird saying that being a man and all but it's true po. I feel
lucky to be by your side and even if sometimes you can't see how
amazing you truly are, I can baby and I love you all the more my 
gwapa prinsesa.

Look at me waxing poetic chu? ahahahha I guess I have to stop stalling
and get around to the actual coding part of making this website for your
birthday baby. It's kind of daunting and exciting all at the same time
and I can't wait to see what you think baby. I love you more than anything
baby and I'll do my absolute best po chu



NOTE (August 8, 2025)

The first web page is mostly done, I'm not overall happy with the design but 
the barebones are there along with navbar and everything. I want to make it
prettier for you chu, I guess I'll see how it goes as time goes on.

The main issue is you can't see the background is a beautiful field of tulips
because of how I designed it. Then again I might go back and change the css to 
optimize it for mobile too.
